This project started as gofer in the early 1990s by Mark Jones then at Oxford.
I started working on it in the mid 90s and the temporary ad hoc name pugofer was used since I was at the time in PU.

Since adoption seems to be picking up (after 30 years!!) the names are now
- =pug= :: the executable
- Pugofer :: the larger system including pug, the philosophy, the pedagogics, style etc

More on the name at [[http://blog.languager.org/2022/03/pugofer-pug.html][pugofer-pug]] and [[http://blog.languager.org/2022/03/a-fairy-tale-and-bridge.html][a fairy tale]]
